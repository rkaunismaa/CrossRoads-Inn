# Session History

A running, step-by-step record of everything done in the Claude Code terminal sessions on this project, in order. Unlike `ai-log.md`, which keeps short notes on successes and failures, this file records the whole sequence of events.

Format: each session has a heading. Each step lists the user's request, then what the agent did and the result.

## Session 1 - 2026-10-23

### 1. "what is happening here?"
- The agent read `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/design.md`. Neither file was committed yet, and the branch was `master`.
- It summarized the project (a Godot 4 resource-management game used as a learning project for AI-assisted game development) and suggested next steps.

### 2. "commit these and rename the branch to main"
- Renamed the branch `master` to `main`.
- Commit `8ca40fb` added the project instructions and the initial design doc.

### 3. "set up the Godot project in game/"
- Godot was not installed. The user chose to have the agent download it to `~/.local/bin`.
- Installed Godot 4.7.2 (latest stable) from the official GitHub releases and checked it against the SHA512 checksums.
- Vendored GUT 9.7.1 into `game/addons/gut`.
- Created:
  - `game/project.godot` (1280x720, GL Compatibility, warnings for untyped declarations)
  - the `InnState` rules class
  - a grey-box main scene
  - two GUT tests
  - `tools/run-tests.sh`
  - `docs/ai-log.md`
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with the test command and folder layout.
- Checked: tests pass with exit 0, a deliberately failing test gives exit 1, and the main scene runs headless with no errors.
- Commit `be9eea9`.

### 4. "I have created https://github.com/rkaunismaa/CrossRoads-Inn.git"
- Confirmed the repo was empty (it is public).
- Added it as `origin`. The HTTPS push failed because no credentials were stored, so the agent switched to the SSH URL, which was already authenticated.
- Pushed `main`. It tracks `origin/main` and is GitHub's default branch.

### 5. "start the paper prototype to balance the numbers"
- Started a design conversation (brainstorming) before building anything.
- Decisions from the user so far:
  - Format: first a spreadsheet, then a script that simulates many runs.
  - Target feel: tight. Most runs should end barely above the coin target.
- The user also asked for this running history file. The agent created it and will keep it up to date.
